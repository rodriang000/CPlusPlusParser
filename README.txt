Angel Rodriguez v. 1.0.whatever.0 Convert Text Software. Copyright "Yaboi" labs. 

How to use: 
-As of now the program only works on Windows (sorry). 
 Make sure that the executable(program) and file are in same folder and run the program. 

-It will prompt you to type the name of the file you want edited, so do so.
 Capital letters don't matter, and if it fails it will tell you that it didn't
 get a "legit" file. Make sure it is typed correctly and if you are stuck just 
 hit CTRL and C at the same time to quit.
